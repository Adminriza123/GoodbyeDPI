Usage: goodbyedpi.exe [OPTION...]
 -p          block passive DPI
 -r          replace Host with hoSt
 -s          remove space between host header and its value
 -m          mix Host header case (test.com -> tEsT.cOm)
 -f [value]  set HTTP fragmentation to value
 -k [value]  enable HTTP persistent (keep-alive) fragmentation and set it to value
 -n          do not wait for first segment ACK when -k is enabled
 -e [value]  set HTTPS fragmentation to value
 -a          additional space between Method and Request-URI (enables -s, may break sites)
 -w          try to find and parse HTTP traffic on all processed ports (not only on port 80)
 --port        [value]    additional TCP port to perform fragmentation on (and HTTP tricks with -w)
 --ip-id       [value]    handle additional IP ID (decimal, drop redirects and TCP RSTs with this ID).
                          This option can be supplied multiple times.
 --dns-addr    [value]    redirect UDP DNS requests to the supplied IP address (experimental)
 --dns-port    [value]    redirect UDP DNS requests to the supplied port (53 by default)
 --dnsv6-addr  [value]    redirect UDPv6 DNS requests to the supplied IPv6 address (experimental)
 --dnsv6-port  [value]    redirect UDPv6 DNS requests to the supplied port (53 by default)
 --dns-verb               print verbose DNS redirection messages
 --blacklist   [txtfile]  perform HTTP tricks only to host names and subdomains from
                          supplied text file. This option can be supplied multiple times.
 --set-ttl     [value]    activate Fake Request Mode and send it with supplied TTL value.
                          DANGEROUS! May break websites in unexpected ways. Use with care.
 --wrong-chksum           activate Fake Request Mode and send it with incorrect TCP checksum.
                          May not work in a VM or with some routers, but is safer than set-ttl.

 -1          -p -r -s -f 2 -k 2 -n -e 2 (most compatible mode, default)
 -2          -p -r -s -f 2 -k 2 -n -e 40 (better speed for HTTPS yet still compatible)
 -3          -p -r -s -e 40 (better speed for HTTP and HTTPS)
 -4          -p -r -s (best speed)
